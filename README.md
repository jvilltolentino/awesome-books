  * The design patterns in this book capture best practices and solutions to recurring problems in machine learning. The authors, three Google engineers, catalog proven methods to help data scientists tackle common problems throughout the ML process. These design patterns codify the experience of hundreds of experts into straightforward, approachable advice. In this book, you will find detailed explanations of 30 patterns for data and problem representation, operationalization, repeatability, reproducibility, flexibility, explainability, and fairness. Each pattern includes a description of the problem, a variety of potential solutions, and recommendations for choosing the best technique for your situation.

* **Machine Learning - A First Course for Engineers and Scientists**](https://smlbook.org/) | Andreas Lindholm, Niklas Wahlström, Fredrik Lindsten, Thomas B. Schön | Cambridge University Press
  * This book covers a selection of supervised machine learning methods, from the most fundamental (k-NN, decision trees, linear and logistic regression) to more advanced methods (deep neural networks, support vector machines, Gaussian processes, random forests and boosting), plus commonly-used unsupervised methods (generative modeling, k-means, PCA, autoencoders and generative adversarial networks). Careful explanations and pseudo-code are presented for all methods. The authors maintain a focus on the fundamentals by drawing connections between methods and discussing general concepts such as loss functions, maximum likelihood, the bias-variance decomposition, ensemble averaging, kernels and the Bayesian approach along with generally useful tools such as regularization, cross validation, evaluation metrics and optimization methods. The final chapters offer practical advice for solving real-world supervised machine learning problems and on ethical aspects of modern machine learning.
